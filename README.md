# SoulsGamesSaveFileOrganiser

A save file organiser for the purpose of practicing segments for speedruns / challenge runs. This was made for a second year college assignment for a module that involved creating WPF applications.

This is the first version of this save file organiser, and at the moment it only gives you options to create categories, segments and savefiles for video games in the Souls series (Dark Souls, Demon's Souls etc.). If I decide to work on this project again I will add the option to add any game of your choice and not cater the app just for souls games.


## Features
- Ability to divide your savestates into categories and segments that you can create. This creates a folder structure where your savefiles will be stored.
- Can choose the folder directory that the games savefiles are located in and where you want to store your savefiles. 
- Can import the savefile from a directory that you created into the chosen games savefile location. This replaces the games savefile with the savefile that you have chosen, allowing you to easily practice segments.
- Ability to delete savefiles, segments and categories that you have created. 
- All the games savefile directory locations and the location for your profiles are saved using JSON.

## Features I would like to add
- Option to create savefiles for any game.
- Replace savefile option.
- Keybinds for importing / replacing a savefile.
